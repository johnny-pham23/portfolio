# About
Talk about yourself


With life being fast-paced with instant results, I grew to enjoy gardening (punn intended). Gardening makes me appreciate patience and consistency when taking care of plants. Seeing the wonderful blooms of plumeria and snapdragon flowers to growing my own peppers and herbs.
